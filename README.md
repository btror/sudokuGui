2. Click on an empty square to highlight it, then press one of the bottom numbers (1-9) to make a guess. You can also click on squares that already contain numbers. Doing so will highlight all of the other squares on the board with the same number filled in.

3. Do your best to fill out the entire board, but be careful! You can only make 3 mistakes! If you guess wrong 3 times you lose!

4. You can customize the appearance of the game to your liking. You can change the font size, grid color, background-color and highlighter color if you don't like the defaults.
